# Kinematics

DoubleSliderCrank.m plots a short animation of a kinematic system which consists of two Slider-Crank linkages that share the same crank. The scirpt was developed for a Kinematics course project. This linkage allowed my team and I to drive the two sliders using one DC motor that actuates the crank. The script was used to synchronise the displacement of the two sliders to the desired positions.
